# Artificial Intelligence and Neural Nets

## _Q: Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?_ ##

### A: A main majority of the code was given, but I was tasked with researching and implementing the appropriate neural network for the machine to learn on its own (reinforcement learning) and be able to navigate to the desired end state of getting treasure hid within a digital maze. Through what I've learned of AI, specific algorithms and functions, along with various methods of learning such as policy vs value (and even actor-critic models which utilize both). Through my journey of understanding and reviewing the emerging trends of AI in the computer science industry, I was able to implement that into the code and successfully implemented a Deep Q-Net (DQN) to have the machine learn through trial and error (exploration & exploitation) to eventually become a highly proficient pirate AI that can quickly navigate and obtain treasure.

## _Q: What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?_ ##

### A: Computer scientists utilize cirtical thinking and problem solving skills to plan, develop, and analyze digital software (and even hardware) that helps solve problems. Their work allows for modern technology to assist society in ways that have made not only entertainment more enjoyable and enhancing the quality of life through tech, but their works have helped make many other fields like telecommunications, healthcare and even scientific research more and more advanced. This growth will continue, as more and more breakthroughs in computer science will help drive humanity into the future and expand our knowledge and capabilities. AI is a massive current trend in the field of computer science, and with enough time it will more than likely become a staple in everyone's lives, much like how smartphones have become ubiquitious for example.

## _Q: How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?_ ##

### A: Understanding the problem first and foremost is essential to approaching any problem. Gathering requirements and fully understanding _why_ the software should be designed helps establish the necessary information to tackle it. For instance, with this project, it was necessary to understand what the intelligent machine needed to do; understanding at the core of what the learning machine needed to accomplish helped me understand and do appropriate research to find and design the best solution to the problem.

## _Q: What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and organizations?_ ##

### A: Ensuring that the system is fully unbiased and accessible is paramount. As many experts and established organizations like the Association for Computing Machinery detail, writing and using code should be done with good moral principles. Any and all software developed should be carefully tested and analyzed to ensure that it does no harm to: the users in society, other organizations, cultures, or the environment. Ensuring that code and machines are designed responsibly with ethics in mind not only ensure that harm is minimized and meets industry best standards, but also helps build trust amongst fellow coding peers and users whilst ensuring the reputation of the organization I work for (or just my own standing) is both upheld and enhanced.
